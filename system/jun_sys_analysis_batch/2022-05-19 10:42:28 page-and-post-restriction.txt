### Q&A ###
###########

1. Why is my plugin in violation against GDPR?

GDPR (https://gdpr-info.eu/) aims to give citizens in the European Union (EU) control over their personal data. If a website collects or store user data, it is required to provide users functionalities to control their data, such as ones to erase or export their data. While a plugin do not directly interact with users, it may provide functionalities that collect or store personal data, which would make websites that deploy the plugin in violation against GDPR if the plugin does not provide corresponding functionalities to allow users control their personal data. Therefore, plugin developers are responsible to provide functions to manage the personal data they handle in accordance with GDPR. We list requirements by specific GDPR articles relevant to your plugin below.


[Art. 13, Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject] If a plugin collects or handles personal data, it needs to provide privacy policy texts that explain what personal data is being collected and for what purpose. The texts are meant to be added to the privacy policy of the websites that deploy the plugin. 


            
[Art.17, Right to erasure] If a plugin stores personal data in a custom database they create or manage, or through Wordpress's native storage functions (e.g., update_user_meta), it needs to provide methods for users to erase the data upon request. Note that deleting data for all users upon uninstallation does not satisfy the requirement. 


            
        

2. How do I make my plugin compliant?

Please refer to the fix report below to see how you can make your plugin comply with GDPR.

### Fix Report ###
##################

############################
# Data Deletion Fix Report #
############################

This report suggests fixes to comply with the GDPR Art. 17, Right to erasure (https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/). The report
is based on guidelines provided by Wordpress. Refer to https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/privacy/adding-the-personal-data-eraser-to-your-plugin/ for more details.

1) Implement a function that deletes all the user data collected in the plugin. Sample code:


/**
* Removes all collected data of a user.
*
* @param string $email_address   email address to manipulate
* @param int    $page            pagination
*
* @return array
*/
function page-and-post-restriction_remove_data( $email_address, $page = 1 ) {
    
    $page = (int) $page;


    //TODO: Delete the user data that was stored using Wordpress functions

    //Below is the sample code for deleting user meta and may need to be modified to suit the plugin.
    $user_id = get_user_by('email', $email_address)
    $key = 'email' //Sample user meta key
    if ( $customer->user_id > 0 ) {
        //Delete user meta data by $key
        delete_user_meta( $user_id, $key );
    }
        



    // Tell core if we have more data to delete still
    $done = true;
    return array(
        'items_removed'  => $items_removed, // true if collected data of a user is being deleted
        'items_retained' => $items_retained, // true if certain data needs to be retained
        'messages'       => sprintf( __( 'Data of user with email %s successfully deleted.', 'page-and-post-restriction' ), $email_address ), // Put messages for data removal
        'done'           => $done, // true if all the removal processes are done (all data of the user is removed)
    );
}
        

2) Hook the deletion function to the Wordpress's Personal Data Removal tool


/**
* Registers all data erasers.
*
* @param array $exporters
*
* @return mixed
*/
function page-and-post-restriction_register_privacy_erasers( $erasers ) {
    $erasers['my-plugin-slug'] = array(
        'eraser_friendly_name' => __( '<eraser name>', 'page-and-post-restriction' ),
        'callback'             => 'page-and-post-restriction_remove_data',
    );
    return $erasers;
}
        

add_filter( 'wp_privacy_personal_data_erasers', 'page-and-post-restriction_register_privacy_erasers' );

# Privacy Policy Fix Report #
#############################

This report suggests fixes to comply with the GDPR Art. 13 (https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) through including a privacy notice. The report
is based on guidelines provided by Wordpress. Refer to https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/privacy/suggesting-text-for-the-site-privacy-policy/ for more details.

1) Implement a function that includes the privacy policy for the plugin and provide it to wordpress through wp_add_privacy_policy_content(). Sample code:


/**
* Adds a privacy policy statement.
*/
function page-and-post-restriction_add_privacy_policy_content() {
    if ( ! function_exists( 'wp_add_privacy_policy_content' ) ) {
        return;
    }
    //TODO: modify the content below to include the privacy policy for the plugin.
    $content = '<p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">' . __( 'Some introductory content for the suggested text.', 'page-and-post-restriction' ) . '</p>'
            . '<strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">' . __( 'Suggested Text:', 'page-and-post-restriction' ) . '</strong> '
            . sprintf(
                __( 'When you leave a comment on this site, we send your name, email address, IP address and comment text to example.com. Example.com does not retain your personal data. The example.com privacy policy is <a href="%1$s" target="_blank">here</a>.', 'page-and-post-restriction' ),
                'https://example.com/privacy-policy'
            );
    wp_add_privacy_policy_content( 'page-and-post-restriction', wp_kses_post( wpautop( $content, false ) ) );
}
        

2) Hook the privacy policy function to the Wordpress's admin initialization action.


add_action( 'admin_init', 'page-and-post-restriction_add_privacy_policy_content' );
